<h1>"Perfect Album Doesn't Exi..." Meme generator</h1>
<p>Use it online <a href="https://devdana.github.io/PerfectAlbum/">Here.</a>

This is simple music meme creator based on album covers fetched from <a href="https://www.deezer.com/en/">Deezer API.</a>
I also have used <a href="https://allorigins.win/">allOrigins</a> proxy to resolve the CORS conflict made with Deezers API response

I don't think anyone ever needs to clone/develop this repo so I created this Github repo merely with the intention of using Github pages for hosting the app. It uses Vue.js as the base framework and Axios to create HTTP requests.
